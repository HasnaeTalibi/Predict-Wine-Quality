# Predict-Wine-Quality
A project investigating the relationship between wine quality and the chemical properties of the wine.
A multiclass classification project


## Analysis and Prediction

Below are the list of works that have been as a part fo this project

Finding out and visualizing Missing values
Distribution check of the wine quality
Relationship between Wine Quality and Alcohol content in the wine
Correlation between predictors and between the predictors and target variables
Removing the Skewness in the predictors for better model predicttion
Outliers Detection
Handling Umbalanced data
Buliding Support Vector Machine and Random Forest and others machine learning algorithms to classify the wine quality
